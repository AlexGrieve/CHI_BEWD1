BEWD: FINAL PROJECT

#DESCRIPTION

https://datadock.io, a bandcamp for front-end developers.

DataDock has a front-end interface like Google, where you enter a URL and the site analyzes it for all web technologies being used. This can be accomplished using a Ruby gem WAPPALYZER.

Home page has open access to everyone and lets you analyze any site. After analyzing and giving you site info, you get a prompt to create an account to start sharing with others. 

You can save the site to your account. This creates a "card" with a screenshot of the site, along with site title, URL, and a list of web technologies. Within this card, you can write a brief description of the site.

By saving multiple sites, you create a hub of websites.

Social aspect: you can gain followers, can follow others and be notified when they favorite new websites.

Two options for saving websites: Save, Save and post.
From saved options, you can segement into lists and email these lists, or provide a URL you can send to others to access this list. 

Optional feature: On saving website to your hub, sockets.io scans for humans.txt file in site and makes this a clickable item in the hub.
